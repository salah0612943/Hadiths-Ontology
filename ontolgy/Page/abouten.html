       The present research attempts to examine the Extraction Ontology and ontological approaches particularly in relation to the traditional Arabic book Riyadh As-Saliheen. Thus, the primary topic of this work is to focus on the viability of applying ontology in the extraction of relations between concepts. Therefore, we propose a formal model of extraction ontological relationships from the book, Riyadh As-Saliheen.
